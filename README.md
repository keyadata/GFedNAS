# GreenFedNAS: Deep Federated Neural Architecture Search for Edge Intelligence

GreenFedNAS is an automated **energy-aware federated neural architecture search (FedNAS)** framework designed for **heterogeneous deep edge intelligence environments**. It enables different clients to train **lightweight, device-adaptive architectures** while efficiently aggregating them into a global model with minimal energy consumption.

## Key Contributions
- Heterogeneous client architectures
- Training-free NAS using **Kernel-based NAS (KNAS)**
- Energy-aware client selection
- Cross-architecture aggregation via:
    - Direct weight injection
    - Knowledge distillation
    - Projection-based alignment
-Energy measurement support (e.g., CodeCarbon, reported in Wh)  
-Paper-oriented experiments: Accuracy–Energy, EER, scalability, and trade-off analyses  

## Framework Highlights

- **Green Federated Learning (Green FL)** focus  
- **NAS-driven automation** 
- **Energy–accuracy trade-off optimisation**
- Designed for **edge devices** (IoT, wearables, mobile, drones)
