# GreenFedNAS: Energy-Efficient Federated Neural Architecture Search

GreenFedNAS is an energy-aware **Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS)** framework designed for **heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge environments** such as IoT sensors, wearables, and drones. The framework jointly optimizes **client participation** and **neural architecture selection** to reduce energy consumption while maintaining strong global model performance under non-IID data.

## Key Contributions
- Energy-aware client participation for heterogeneous devices  
- Lightweight, client-adaptive architectures (parameter- and FLOPs-efficient)  
- Federated aggregation tailored for non-IID settings  
- Energy measurement support (e.g., CodeCarbon, reported in Wh)  
- Paper-oriented experiments: Accuracy–Energy, EER, scalability, and trade-off analyses
